# Adhoc Network Creator
What is ?
Adhoc Network Creator is an amazing tool that is used for creating Adhoc Wifi network in any Windows Enviorment and Specially Windows 8.
Why this ?
As in Windows 8 Single Language there is no predefined tool for creating the Adhoc Wifi network as it was in Previous versions of windows. So Adhoc Network creator provide us a way of creating Adhoc Wifi Network by using its simple GUI.
